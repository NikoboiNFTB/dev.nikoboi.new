# GEMINI.md - Instructional Context

## Project Overview
**Nikoboi's Personal Landing Page (`dev.nikoboi.new`)**
A modern, responsive, and minimalist personal portal that showcases Nikoboi's projects, including web applications, browser extensions (Firefox Add-ons), userscripts, and social links. The project is a static website built with pure HTML and CSS, designed for high performance and visual clarity.

### Main Technologies
- **HTML5:** Semantic markup for structured content.
- **CSS3:** Modern CSS with custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and "glassmorphism" effects.
- **Assets:** A structured repository of custom and third-party icons (FontAwesome, Wikimedia, etc.).

### Architecture
- **Root Directory:** Contains the main landing page (`index.html`, `style.css`).
- **Assets (`/assets/`):** Organized by source and purpose (e.g., `nikoboi/` for branding, `wikimedia/` for external logos, `favicon/` for site-specific icons).
- **Revisions (`/rev*/`):** Directories containing previous iterations or experimental versions generated by different AI models.

## Building and Running
This is a **purely static project**. There is no build or compilation step.

### Local Development
- Open `index.html` directly in any modern web browser.
- Alternatively, serve locally using a simple web server:
  - **Python:** `python3 -m http.server 8000`
  - **Node.js (serve):** `npx serve .`

### Deployment
- Deployed via **GitHub Pages** (implied by `CNAME` and repository structure).
- Primary Domain: `new.nikoboi.dev`

## Development Conventions

### Coding Style
- **Vanilla CSS:** Prefer standard CSS over pre-processors or utility-first frameworks unless explicitly requested.
- **Modern UI Patterns:** Utilize `backdrop-filter` for translucent elements, smooth transitions for interactivity, and responsive grid layouts.
- **CSS Variables:** Use `--var-name` defined in `:root` for consistent colors, sizes, and spacing.

### Asset Management
- **Pathing:** Always use absolute-style paths (starting with `/assets/`) for images and icons to ensure compatibility with sub-directories.
- **Icon Formatting:** Prefer SVG for scalability and performance. Use specific classes like `.icon.filter` for dark-mode compatible monochromatic icons.

### Responsive Design
- The site follows a mobile-first philosophy. Ensure all `link-row` grids and navigation elements adapt to screen widths below `768px` and `480px`.

### Project Structure Notes
- **`rev*` Directories:** These are archival or experimental. Do not modify these unless specifically instructed to iterate on a past version.
- **`CNAME`:** Must always contain `new.nikoboi.dev` for proper domain mapping.
